T: From your perspective, what happened in 2008?
R: I remember we had long positions, most of our liquidity
was invested in bonds. Thanks to the repo market,
we could invest in bonds indirectly by lending collateral.
When the crisis came, our portfolio had big losses, about 10% to 20%.
It was a difficult moment, but we recovered in the next few years.
It was a very unique crisis, bottoming out twice.
Regarding me personally, I was working as a bond analyst and doing
algorithmic trading on credit indexes, going long or short depending on MAs.
While my own position was very successful, the bank had 
losses on our trading account.

You see, a bank is not a hedge fund and doesn't use the same accounting methods.
Some banks don't even have a proprietary trading account, and keep their
positions on a banking book. In a banking book, the P&L doesn't matter
unless you must sell.

We didn't have to sell anything because of the accounting methods,
though.
Our banking book used available for sale (AFS) and yield to maturity (YTM)
to calculate P&L. Normally, we hold bonds until they expire and get the principal back.
This way, it doesn't matter what happens in the bond market after you buy the bond.
The only time you are forced to sell is when your ratios surpass certain limits.

My division was taking care of the banking book at the time
