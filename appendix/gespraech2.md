Interview 2
Interview zwischen T. Rossi* und G. Tomitsuka. Rossi ist ein
italienischer H\"andler, der daf\"ur bekannt ist, dass er
als einziger H\"andler in seiner gesamten Bank w\"ahrend der Finanzkrise 2008
mehrere Millionen an Profiten erzeugen konnte.
Dieses Interview wurde auf Englisch gef\"uhrt.

T: From your perspective, what happened in 2008?
R: I remember we had long positions, most of our liquidity
was invested in bonds. Thanks to the repo market,
we could invest in bonds indirectly by lending collateral.
When the crisis came, our portfolio had big losses, about 10% to 20%.
It was a difficult moment, but we recovered in the next few years.
It was a very unique crisis, bottoming out twice.
Regarding me personally, I was working as a bond analyst and doing
algorithmic trading on credit indexes, going long or short depending on MAs.
While my own position was very successful, the bank had 
losses on our trading account.

You see, a bank is not a hedge fund and doesn't use the same accounting methods.
Some banks don't even have a proprietary trading account, and keep their
positions on a banking book. In a banking book, the P&L doesn't matter
unless you must sell.

We didn't have to sell anything because of the accounting methods,
though, and therefore didn't book a loss.
Our banking book used available for sale (AFS) and yield to maturity (YTM)
to calculate P&L. Normally, we hold bonds until they expire and get the principal back.
This way, it doesn't matter what happens in the bond market after you buy the bond.
The only time you are forced to sell is when your ratios surpass certain limits.

My division was taking care of the banking book at the time, and one thing I
realized is that this accounting method was wonderful, as we could ignore
what was happening on the markets. While our smaller trading
account did bleed, we ended up recovering by 2011.

The only thing we had to respect were the ratios. I remember that the
liquidity cover ratio was the scariest, but there were many more, such as the capital ratio.

These ratios are the boundaries you must stay within as a bank.
I agree with their existence, though, as it's important that regulators keep the leverage
multipliers under control -- a crisis of highly leveraged banks is much harder to contain
than a regular one.

The crisis forced deleverage because ratios were outside their legal boundaries,
which brought huge losses on balance sheets.
The ratios got into this situation because the bank was forced to sell for any reason.
Selling at a loss reduces your available capital, which ratios account for. 

As a bank, you must replace this capital.

Some of our competitors (other Italian banks) were in this exact situation. They
broke the legal ratio boundaries and needed to recapitalize. The shareholders'
weren't in a position to do it so either the government had to step in or
the bank had to declare bankruptcy. This is exactly
what happened to RBS -- in fact, the RBS bailout was so expensive that the Irish
government had to raise capital to fund it (though their access to the ECB and IMF
simplified this part).

In my eyes, this is how the finacial crisis became a systemic crisis.

G: Thank you so much for the thorough description. What changed since 2008?

T: Well, regulators creeated more rules to control banks and protect clients, forcing them to be
more transparency.
There is new legislation reffering to returns and a new asset weighting methodology.
This one is quite interesting, as it had different weights for different position types.
For example, the weight for an European government bond is zero, while the weight for stocks is
100. How the weighting exactly happens is really in MIFID 2, I recommend you read it if you want to understand this on a deeper level.
Basel III has new ways to define which ratios must be followed and how they are calculated as well.

G: Did Europe overregulate its banks?

T: Good question. I genuinely am not sure. US banks were able to stay more competitive, taking some market share from EU banks, which reduced the EU banks' profitability even further.
I'd say the biggest challenge is maintaining profitability,
