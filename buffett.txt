Buffett:
You had people think that housing could do nothing but go up and you had a 20 trillion dollar market in residential housing and
so it was a big asset class and people started using it as a currency and they basically found out it wasn't straight up
and they borrowed on them and there were levels of participation up and down the line I mean people at the top were
writing mortgages they knew they'd never have to hold, so they'd sell them to someone in Norway
after they'd been put it in a package and you had people refinancing where it didn't make a difference, the monthly payments were too high.

Basically just had a huge speculation in housing and 50 million of the 75 million owner occupied homes in the US were mortgaged
but you literally had a crash in the value of something that 50 million families owned, owned on margin, had thought were going to go up, 
they based their living standards on it in many cases, they borrowed against it and it was unlikely any widerspread financial crisis.
When people start believing something kind of crazy you get that sort of thing.
